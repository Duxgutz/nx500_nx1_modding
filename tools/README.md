#Directory holding various small tools

These are small tools, either one-off or testing for development programs.

They all work in following manner:
  1. Download the ZIP file
  2. Unpack it to SD card root (so that the topmost directory of the card has a file named **info.tg** in it)
  3. Pop the battery out of the camera; Put the card in camera; Pop the battery in camera
  4. Turn on the camera
  5. Follow on-screen instructions

**IMPORTANT - This SD card will start the camera in "Factory mode" that has limited touchscreen (and other) functionality. To normally test/use the camera, remove this card (or delete file info.tg or format the card) and power on the camera.**

These tools are useful if don't want to hack your camera or you want to try something out without messing your already hacked camera, etc.
